# WEATHER APP


Hey, this is simple React app that displays data from   [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

#### React with Hooks
I've made this project to test React's new feature hooks. Hooks are functions that let you use React's state and lifecycle methods inside function components. They eliminate need to use javascript classes thus allowing us to write cleaner and more readable code.

### Made with
-   React (Unstable release 16.8.0-alpha.1 with hooks )
-   Bootstrap (Grid, utilities and minimal styling )
-   SASS (CSS extension)
-   Redux (State container)
-   FontAwesome (Web icons)
-   axios (HTTP client)
