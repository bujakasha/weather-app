#### React with Hooks
Project uses unstable versio of React that includes hooks. Hooks are functions that let you use Reacts state and lifecycle methods inside function components. Using hooks makes code cleaner and more readable by removing the need of classes. Custom hooks separate functions that allows us to extract and reuse component logic. 


### Made with
-   React (Unstable release 16.8.0-alpha.1 with hooks )
-   Bootstrap (Grid, utilities and minimal styling )
-   SASS (CSS extension)
-   Redux (State container)
-   FontAwesome (Web icons)
-   axios (HTTP client)
